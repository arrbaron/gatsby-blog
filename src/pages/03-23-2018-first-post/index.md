Hello! My name is Roy Baron and I'm a web developer. Congratulations on stumbling across my blog. You have officially completed the internet. Hooray!

### Who are you?
I thought I already answered that. Well, alright. Here are some more details.
I come from a background in game design, which is what I studied and have had professional experience
(~ 1 year) in. If you're curious about my game development experience, a few of my more notable projects are 
[Quibly Ball](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3sVbddtvvg), [Get Water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3i9wInBZcnk&t=113s), and [TB2](https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/tb2-malis-ancient-manuscripts).

In the last year or so, I decided to pivot from game design to web development for a few reasons:

1. Greater variety of projects. So many awesome things can be built on the web, including games.
Slime Soccer, anyone?

_Oh, the glory days_

2. More opportunities. I think that goes without saying.

3. I like knowing I'm in an industry where, if I wanted to, I could go and move to a new country and live there comfortably while working remote. In fact, while I was traveling in Cambodia there was this guy there from Russia who I met that was doing exactly that. He just seemed so... _peaceful_. He seemed like he had things figured out.

4. Last and maybe most importantly, web development always seemed so __impossible__ when I was growing up. I remember looking at a web page and thinking. __Wow. I'll never be smart enough to understand how to make something like this.__ All I wanted to do was edit my Neopets store but HTML looked so terrifying that poor little [EvilRex23](http://www.neopets.com/login/index.phtml?destination=/petlookup.phtml?pet=EvilRex23) would just have to do without a fancy schmancy store. _Except for some totally rocking 8bit version of Nirvana's Smells Like Teen Spirit, of course._ 

![a collection of different neopets](http://cdn.player.one/sites/player.one/files/styles/full_large/public/2016/07/20/neopets.png)_still gets me excited to look at these_

So for a long time, web development had always been my white whale. That is until one day back in high school I decided to give it a shot. I figured it was time to get my hands dirty and try it. I had all the strength of teenage angst behind me and the world didn't understand me but _computers understood me_, man. 

Well, it turns out computers didn't understand me either. Not one bit. I have a very vivid memory of going through a very basic html tutorial where I was __finally__ beginning to understood how to sling some web code together. Everything was going great. Until the the tutorial moved onto CSS.

That's when despair struck. The author started introducing all of these strange property names and values and what are these squiggly brackets? I was just getting used to the greater than less than brackets! <-_->. The moment that broke me, however, was when he introduced this little beauty:

```
p {
  color: cornflowerblue;
}
```

It was then that I thought that web developers had to be super geniuses to be able to summon up all of these intricate color names at will. And that I would never be a super genius. But here I am. A web developer who has (mostly) overcome his bad case of the __cornflowerblues__ (get it? that's the title of the blog!).

### If you're not a super genius, why should I be reading your blog?

I think specifically _because_ I'm not a super genius that what I'll be writing will be valuable. Older and wiser (and armed with some advice from [Josh Waitzkin, the chess prodigy](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Learning-Journey-Optimal-Performance/dp/0743277465)) I've learned the secret to learning is not super genius; it's persistence.

And so this blog will be a mix of new developer advice, cool stuff I'm working on, and other miscellaneous web dev tidbits.

### How can I contact you?

Wow. We just met. Don't you think we're moving a little fast? No? Well then, you can get in touch via [email](mailto:baron.roy@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/roybarondeveloper/).

__Thanks for reading!__
