In the last couple of months or so, I've decided to learn modern layout techniques like flexbox and css grid to the point where I don't have to constantly reference [csstricks](https://css-tricks.com/). Up until now, I was probably responsible for about 10% of their traffic so my apologies to the fine folks over at csstricks (although there are still a ton of reasons to visit anyways).

### How did you learn flexbox and grid?

There are dozens of ways to learn but what really made them stick for me were the [mastery courses](https://geddski.teachable.com/) from Dave Geddes. For flexbox there's [Flexbox Zombies](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/flexbox-zombies) and [Grid Critters](https://geddski.teachable.com/p/gridcritters) for, you guessed it, css grid. 

They're both games with characters, dialogue, and gameplay aimed at making you master their respective technique. In Flexbox Zombies, for example, you take on the role of a young crossbow wielding apprentice who has to fight off zombies using different flexbox positioning techniques.

Grid Critters is similar, although it replaces the zombie aesthetic for a space station and sarcastic robot. Flexbox Zombies is being offered for free while Grid Critters is $225 USD. I recommend trying out Flexbox Zombies and if you like the teaching style, buy the grid course.

### But how can you learn from a game?

I'm sure you've heard all about gamification etc. etc. by now and I think it's largely overused. However, in some cases, framing something as a game really helps in solidifying concepts. Both games focus on repetition and slowly progress in difficulty, something games are known for.

When playing, I found myself forgetting I was learning abstract CSS concepts and instead was focused on killing those damn zombies. When I went back to coding my own layouts, I was surprised to learn that I had the relevant syntax memorized. All from killing zombies and saving cute critters!

### What if I don't believe in your hippy learning techniques?

Hey. Don't call me a hippy. But that's fine. there are plenty of more traditional offerings for helping you learn this stuff. You could always go and read the documentation. *shudders*

But no, there are plenty of happy mediums like Wes Bos' [flexbox](https://flexbox.io/) and [grid](https://cssgrid.io/) courses. He has a fun and engaging style that a lot of people really enjoy.

### Thanks! And I'm sorry for calling you a hippy

It's okay. I forgive (but I never forget). Whatever method you end up using to learn these two modern layout techniques; just learn them! They're crucial, invaluable, vital, and will be everywhere in the future. 

### Wait but do I really need to learn both? How do they work together?

That, my friend, will be the subject of part 2 of this article! And I'll also be sharing some techniques for practicing these skills once you've got the concepts down.

Thanks again for reading!
